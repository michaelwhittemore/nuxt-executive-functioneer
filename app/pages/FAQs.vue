        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>Do you have ADHD?</b> <br /> Nope. What I have is enough executive functioning that I have extra to
            sell to you! For what it's worth, I'm definitely in the neurodiverse category - I'll be happy to disclose
            everything that's wrong with my brain if you ask.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>What kinds of clients do you work with?</b> <br /> I work with any adults (18+) who have ADHD or
            ADHD-like challenges. The majority of my clients realized they had ADHD as adults, rather than being
            diagnosed as children.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>What forms of payment do you accept?</b> <br /> I accept paypal, venmo, checks, or cash.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>When is payment due?</b> <br /> At the very end of a session. I like to do it this way so that neither
            of us has to rely on memory or reminders. Once we've concluded our session, I will give you my venmo or
            paypal info and make sure the transaction goes through.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>What happens in an intro session?</b> <br /> You will get a google meet link in your email. I will
            introduce myself, you will introduce yourself, and then I will ask you a series of questions to determine
            how best I can help you. It will take 20-30 minutes. There is absolutely zero preparation required on your
            part, and this first session costs $0.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>How long is a typical session? What's the agenda?</b> <br /> Sessions last from 2 to 6 hours, depending
            on client preference. We can spend the entire time working on your space, but I have other options available
            (see <NuxtLink to="/pricing">Pricing and Services</NuxtLink> for a full list of services). I will spend the session working closely with you to
            help you make good choices, stay on-task, and feel motivated and supported.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>Do I need a formal ADHD diagnosis to work with you?</b> <br /> Goodness no.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>What are your qualifications for this work?</b> <br /> I could tell you I'm a certified blahblahblah,
            but personal coaching is a bit of a wild west with no clear standard. I do have a science degree from
            Columbia University, so I'm pretty smart. However, my biggest qualification is that I am a total nerd about
            ADHD. Not only have I done extensive research into causes and coping mechanisms, but I've worked with
            friends and clients to test out what works and what doesn't. I'm also a very compassionate and mindful
            person who truly enjoys helping people with brain challenges. If you're still undecided over whether I'm
            worth the $, please see my <NuxtLink to="/testimonials">testimonials page</NuxtLink>.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>Do I have to be home while you work?</b> <br /> Nope! If you prefer to just give me directions remotely and have me work while you're out, that's an option. Just make sure someone can let me into the house.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>Where do you operate?</b> <br /> The San Francisco Bay Area at large. My home base is in Oakland.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>How much stuff is too much stuff? Is there anything that would make you refuse a job?</b> <br /> There's no such thing as too much stuff. The only way I would refuse a job is if I either physically can't get into the home or I have a concern for my safety due to loose needles, active bedbug/flea/scabies infestations, bodily fluids, etc. Otherwise, I'm good to go.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>Do you have experience with individuals who have hoarding disorder?</b> <br /> Yes - I've done multiple jobs for clients with hoarding disorder. If you have or suspect you suffer from hoarding disorder, please let me know in our intro call. This will help me manage expectations accordingly. (Specifically, progress will be slower due to the underlying difficulties of the disorder.)</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>Do you clean as well as declutter?</b> <br /> I don't provide full cleaning services, purely because I'm not going to do as good a job as any given professional cleaner you could hire. I can handle basics like sweeping up and wiping surfaces clean. I'm looking to partner with a cleaning service in the future.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>Do you offer remote services?</b> <br /> Remote services are definitely on the table! The pricing structure would be different; I would remove the 2-hour minimum and just charge $50 flat per video call. If this is what you're looking for, please mention it in our intro call.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <p> <b>Can I see pictures of your cats?</b> <br /> Book an intro session with me and I will personally hold a
            tabby up to the camera.</p>

            <p> <b>Do you have ADHD?</b> <br /> Nope. What I have is enough executive functioning that I have extra to sell to you! For what it's worth, I'm definitely in the neurodiverse category - I'll be happy to disclose everything that's wrong with my brain if you ask.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <p> <b>What is ADHD coaching?</b> <br /> ADHD coaching helps you build tools and systems for managing focus, organization, and motivation. It's a practical, forward-focused partnership to help you take action and create change.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <p> <b>How is coaching different from therapy?</b> <br /> Therapy explores emotions, trauma, and the past. Coaching focuses on concrete actions that can be done in the here-and-now; building habits, starting routines, completing tasks, meeting goals, etc.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <p> <b>What kinds of clients do you work with?</b> <br /> I work with any adults (18+) who have ADHD or ADHD-like challenges. The majority of my clients realized they had ADHD as adults, rather than being diagnosed as children.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <p> <b>What forms of payment do you accept?</b> <br /> I accept paypal or venmo.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <p> <b>When is payment due?</b> <br /> At the very end of a session. I like to do it this way so that neither of us has to rely on memory or reminders. Once we've concluded our session, I will give you my venmo or paypal info and make sure the transaction goes through.</p>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <p> <b>What happens in an intro session?</b> <br /> You will get a google meet link in your email. I will introduce myself, you will introduce yourself, and then I will ask you a series of questions to determine how best I can help you. It will take 20-30 minutes. There is absolutely zero preparation required on your part, and this first session costs $0.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <p> <b>What happens in a typical session, and how long are they?</b> <br /> Typically, sessions last 1 hour, but this can vary based on preference. We will spend the session working through 1-2 items of your choosing. I will spend the session typing up a a google doc summarizing what we worked on to send you afterwards.</p>

            <p> <b>Do I need a formal ADHD diagnosis to work with you?</b> <br /> Goodness no.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <p> <b>Do you offer in-person support?</b> <br /> If you're local to the Bay Area, ask me about in-person sessions! I've done in-person decluttering and organization.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="faq-item">
            <p> <b>What are your qualifications for this work?</b> <br /> I could tell you I'm a certified blahblahblah, but personal coaching is a bit of a wild west with no clear standard. I do have a science degree from Columbia University, so I'm pretty smart. However, my biggest qualification is that I am a total nerd about ADHD. Not only have I done extensive research into causes and coping mechanisms, but I've worked with friends and clients to test out what works and what doesn't. I'm also a very compassionate and mindful person who truly enjoys helping people with brain challenges. If you're still undecided over whether I'm worth the $, my testimonials page is coming soon.</p>

            <p> <b>Can I see pictures of your cats?</b> <br /> Book an intro session with me and I will personally hold a tabby up to the camera.</p>

                    I worked in her fields
                    And under her trees
                    I picked all her cotton
                    It stung me like bees
                    I shoveled her dirt
                    When no one else would
                    I gave her way more
                    Than I ever should
                    And I'm still here with nothing
                    Whatsoever
                    So I'm gonna work on Maggie's farm forever
                </div>

                    I ground down my knuckles for nothing at all
                    I've worked on my knees till I couldn't crawl
                    I've felt so worthless I can hardly recall
                    A time before she had me trapped in her wall
                    The odds of me leaving are slim to almost never
                    Yeah I'm gonna work on Maggie's farm forever
                </div>
                <div class="testimonial-box rounded yellow-pricing-box">

                    I've thought to myself in the darkest of nights
                    Of freedom above me where all is alright
                    But I wake up so cold on a cracked wooden floor
                    And I've got to admit I'm not sure anymore
                    Yeah I live in this endless misery however
                    Yeah I'm gonna work on Maggie's farm forever

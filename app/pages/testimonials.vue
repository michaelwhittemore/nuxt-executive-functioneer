                I've thought to myself in the darkest of nights
                Of freedom above me where all is alright
                But I wake up so cold on a cracked wooden floor
                And I've got to admit I'm not sure anymore
                Yeah I live in this endless misery however
                Yeah I'm gonna work on Maggie's farm forever

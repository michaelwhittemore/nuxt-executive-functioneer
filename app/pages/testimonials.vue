                    Mikah is an incredibly effective coach! She gracefully introduces emotion regulation techniques and
                    can help with grounding when I'm too stressed to do things. At the same time, she's task-focused and
                    not afraid to get into the thick of things with mess. I love how seamlessly she flips between
                    managing emotional overwhelm and actually getting tasks accomplished. In my experience, that's a
                    really rare gift, to be able to give both comfort and structure as they're needed. <br />
